## Introduction
This project was initiated to assist a government project construction company in diversifying its business operations into new, revenue-stable terrains. The goal is to manage cash-flow volatility and hedge against foreign exchange risk.

## Objectives
- To identify new business areas with stable revenue potential.
- To analyze the feasibility of exporting primary products.
- To understand the correlation between export sales and currency hedging.
- To assess the impact of operational hedging on financial hedging.

## Literature Review
Several studies have established the correlation between export sales and currency hedging behavior:
- Geczy et al. (1997)
- He and Ng (1998)
- Allayannis and Ofek (2001)

Particularly, Kuzmina & Kuznetsova (2018) provided insights into the joint impact of export and import exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. They illustrated how matching foreign-currency-denominated revenues with costs (operational hedging) affects financial hedging.

## Market Feasibility Study

### Products Analyzed
- Raw Cashew Nuts (RCN)
- Sesame Seeds
- Soya Beans

### Methodology
The feasibility study involved:
- Initial capital outflow analysis
- Market risk assessment
- Regulatory risk assessment
- Potential return evaluation

### Findings
The study revealed the viability of exporting these primary products, with a comprehensive analysis of the potential risks and returns. The findings suggested that entering these markets could provide a stable revenue stream and serve as an effective hedge against foreign exchange risk.

## Potential Risks
- Market Risks: Price volatility, competition
- Regulatory Risks: Export regulations, compliance issues

## Potential Returns
- Stable revenue from high-demand primary products
- Effective management of foreign exchange exposure

## Conclusion
Diversifying into the export of primary products like raw cashew nuts, sesame seeds, and soya beans presents a viable opportunity for the company to achieve revenue stability and mitigate foreign exchange risk.

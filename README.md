## Introduction
This project aims to present a sustainable business expansion strategy by delving into exportable primary products. Our focus is to improve revenue stability, manage cash-flow volatility, and mitigate foreign exchange risk for a government project construction company.

## Project Background
Last year, I volunteered as an executive consultant for a government project construction company. The company was seeking new business avenues with stable revenue potential to counteract cash-flow volatility and hedge against foreign exchange risks. Drawing from my interest in how export sales and currency hedging are interconnected, I proposed a market feasibility study to explore the potential of exporting primary products.

Inspired by the work of Kuzmina & Kuznetsova (2018), which examines the combined impact of export and import exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, my team and I embarked on this research journey. Their insights on operational hedging—matching foreign-currency-denominated revenues with foreign-currency-denominated costs—highlighted a strategic approach that we aimed to leverage.

## Objectives
- Identify new business areas with stable revenue potential.
- Analyze the feasibility of exporting primary products.
- Understand the correlation between export sales and currency hedging.
- Assess the impact of operational hedging on financial hedging.

## Literature Review
Several studies have explored the link between export sales and currency hedging behavior:
- Geczy et al. (1997)
- He and Ng (1998)
- Allayannis and Ofek (2001)

Kuzmina & Kuznetsova (2018) provided crucial insights into the joint impact of export and import exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. They demonstrated how matching foreign-currency-denominated revenues with costs (operational hedging) affects financial hedging.

## Market Feasibility Study

### Products Analyzed
- Raw Cashew Nuts (RCN)
- Sesame Seeds
- Soya Beans

### Methodology
We conducted a comprehensive feasibility study that involved:
- Initial capital outflow analysis
- Market risk assessment
- Regulatory risk assessment
- Potential return evaluation

### Findings
The study revealed the viability of exporting these primary products. Our analysis detailed the initial capital requirements, identified potential market and regulatory risks, and evaluated the potential returns. The findings suggested that entering these markets could provide a stable revenue stream and serve as an effective hedge against foreign exchange risk.

## Potential Risks
- **Market Risks:** Price volatility, competition
- **Regulatory Risks:** Export regulations, compliance issues

## Potential Returns
- Stable revenue from high-demand primary products
- Effective management of foreign exchange exposure

## Implementation Plan
1. **Initial Investment:** Secure capital for initial outflows.
2. **Market Entry:** Begin with small-scale exports to test the waters.
3. **Risk Management:** Implement both operational and financial hedging strategies.
4. **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensure all export activities comply with relevant regulations.
5. **Scaling Up:** Gradually increase export volumes based on initial successes and market feedback.

## Conclusion
Diversifying into the export of primary products like raw cashew nuts, sesame seeds, and soya beans presents a viable opportunity for the company to achieve revenue stability and mitigate foreign exchange risk. This strategic expansion is backed by thorough research and a detailed implementation plan to ensure success.
